NET-2220  Playbook Template (artifact-only)

Students: fork this repository, complete the weekly PLAYBOOK_ENTRY.md in each WeekNN_<Title> folder, and add supporting artifacts (screenshots, logs, small text files) to WeekNN/assets/. 

Important:
- Do not modify other students' files.
- MindTap artifacts and grades are handled by Cengage/Blackboard and are NOT required here.
- For the final project (Week 8), include your published portfolio URL in the Week08/PLAYBOOK_ENTRY.md.

See CONTRIBUTING.md for submission workflow and file naming conventions.
